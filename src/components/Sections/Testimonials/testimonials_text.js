					informative and constructive, and helped me bring out the best in my resume. Caitlin help me
					pinpoint the areas of my resume that needed tweaking, as well as highlighting my skills and

					needs as a student coming out of school in search of employment and the points I should focus on in

					I wholeheartedly recommend Caitlin's resume services if you are looking to transform your resume
					into a tool that will land you interviews at companies you've targeted and for the positions you are
					most interested in. <br />
					<br />I initially contacted Caitlin because I felt my resume was an accurate representation of my
					experience and abilities, but it didn't really "sell me" and it needed a boost of energy. Since she
					is a recruiter herself, I figured she'd have a good handle on what grabs recruiter's attention.
					<br />
					<br /> She is an excellent listener and quickly understood what I had to offer and what I was
					looking for. She overhauled my resume to give higher priority to things I hadn't thought of;
					injected appropriate keywords to help me get over the hurdle of applicant tracking systems; and
					transformed my resume for my flat, dull document to one that really works. I've gotten a lot more
					interviews since she helped me!

					With great articulation and attention to detail, she revamped my resume, cover letter, and LI
					profile. She took seemingly mundane details about my background and experience and turned them into
					bold, concise facts that grab your attention. She also provided great insight into salary
					negotiation, job search and networking tips. I feel far more confident and in control of my job
					search and career strategy. I am extremely satisfied with her results. I highly recommend Caitlin.
